This will be an overview of the memory analyzer tool and settings.

Open Source MAT Download:  https://www.eclipse.org/mat/downloads.php
Must have Java 11 or better JDK.
In the MemoryAnalyzer.ini, make sure to add two lines showing the full path to the JDK
    -vm
    C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11\bin\javaw.exe

The -vmargs setting for max heap size is -Xmx1024m.  This can be adjusted to accomodate larger heaps but should not exceed the resource limitations of the machine where MAT is running.

The heap dump should be in .hprof format.  See AcquiringHPROFBinaryHeapDumps.txt in this repo.

Leak Suspects Report - Check the heap dump for leak suspects. Report what objects are kept alive and why they are not garbage collected
Note for Leak Suspects Report - The report created will be in a zip file in the same folder as the heap dump.  It will be <filename>_Leak_Suspects.zip.  Unzip the file and open Index.html in a browser to view the report.

Component Report - Analyze a set of objects for suspected memory issues:  duplicate Strings, empty collections, finalizer, weak references, etc.
Note for component report - will need to show regex for fully qualified class names of the component.
